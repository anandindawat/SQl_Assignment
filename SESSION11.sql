1. Create a SQL query using a subquery in the WHERE clause to find all restaurants from a 'Restaurants' table whose average rating is higher than the average rating of all restaurants in the city.

SELECT *
FROM Restaurants r
WHERE r.rating > (
    SELECT AVG(r2.rating)
    FROM Restaurants r2
    WHERE r2.city = r.city
);


2. Write a SQL query that uses a subquery in the SELECT statement to display each user's name from a 'Users' table along with the total number of orders they have placed from an 'Orders' table, like a summary you might see in a Zomato user profile.

SELECT 
    u.username,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Orders o
        WHERE o.user_id = u.id
    ) AS total_orders
FROM Users u;


3. Given a 'Movies' table and a 'Reviews' table, write a SQL query using IN with a subquery to list all movies that have at least one review with a rating of 5 stars, as seen in BookMyShow's top-rated section.

SELECT *
FROM Movies
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT movie_id
    FROM Reviews
    WHERE rating = 5
);

4. Write a nested SQL query to find the names of all sellers from a 'Sellers' table on a Flipkart-style platform who have sold products in every category listed in a 'Categories' table.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use nested subqueries to compare seller's categories with the complete list of categories.</em>

SELECT s.name
FROM Sellers s
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Categories c
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM Products p
        WHERE p.seller_id = s.id
          AND p.category_id = c.id
    )
);
